Next Word Predictor
Overview:
The Next Word Predictor project aims to develop a predictive text model capable of suggesting the most likely next word given a sequence of input words. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically language modeling, to build a predictive model that enhances user experience in various applications such as text editors, messaging platforms, or virtual keyboards.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and preprocessing of text data, including tokenization, stemming, and removing stopwords to prepare it for training.
N-Gram Language Models: Implements various n-gram models (unigram, bigram, trigram, etc.) to capture the probability distribution of words given their preceding context.
Statistical Techniques: Utilizes statistical techniques such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or smoothed probability distributions to handle data sparsity issues and improve prediction accuracy.
Neural Language Models: Explores neural network-based approaches such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer architectures like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for more context-aware and dynamic predictions.
